    "The Lady Drinking Tea was an experiment described by Prof. Roland Fisher in his book The Design Of Experiments [1]. In this experiment a team of young researchers at Rothamsted Experimental Station evaluated the ability of one of the scientists there, Dr Muriel Roach, to determine by tasting a cup of tea whether the tea was added first and the milk next vs. the milk first and the tea next to the cup[2].\n"

    "#### Miffy or Tiffy\n",
    "When making tea ISO 3103 which is the international standard for brewing tea recommends adding milk first[4] as does the British Standards Authority, at least according to Toksvig, Davies et al[5]. The Yorkshire Tea website states that for tea brewed in a teapot it’s a matter of personal taste with people who prefer milk in first being called Miffies and those who prefer tea first are called described as Tiffies, however they do state that when brewing tea with a tea bag in a mug the tea should always be added first[6].

    "#### The Experiment\n",
    "The experiment involves preparing eight cups of tea, with four made in one manner and four in another and then presenting them to the lady in a randomized order for evaluation. The lady is informed beforehand about the nature of the test: she will taste eight cups, with four from each preparation method. Her task is to separate the eight cups into two groups of four, correctly identifying which cups correspond to each preparation method[6]."
